      <p>
        Once being acquainted with the comment on verse one, we can agree that
        these Magi chose the worst possible title of the Messiah to break the
        news to herod: <b>βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων</b> <b>("King of the Jews.")</b>
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        His entire life Herod has been fighting for recognition from the Jews
        not only as their king, but also as a Jew. He has achieved the first but
        he has not had the same luck withe the second one. In fact they never
        will come to recognize him as a Jew <sup><b class="c-pink">1</b></sup
        >. <br />Now he has to face reality. His greatest fear has come true:
        the <b> Jew of Jews</b> has been born. Someone from the lineage of David
        with all the rights to the throne and long-awaited by all Jews. This
        Messiah is supposed to be the greatest political figure and war general
        <sup><b class="c-pink">2</b></sup> who would finally overthrow the yoke

        >. We can only imagine the fear and anxiety that took Herod when hearing

      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        it is important to note that the tile <b> "King of the Jews"</b> will
        never be used in a genuine way in the rest of the Gospels by a Jew, and
        perhaps by a gentile either, since the only other person who might be
        argued to use it genuinely is Pilate, and it is hard to conclude whether
        he presented Him as <b>King of the Jews</b> in a mocking way or whether
        he was actually serious
        <b class="bg-green--l">(John 19:19; John 19:14; John 18:39)</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        However, even if we give Pilate the benefit of doubt and take the
        position that he was indeed being genuine, he would have been the only
        other individual in the pages of the Gospels using the term in a serious
        manner. Therefore, out of the
        <span class="bg-purple--d">(at least) 15 times</span> that
        <b>King of the Jews</b> appears in the Bible only
        <span class="bg-purple--d">2 times </span
        ><b class="bg-green--l">(John 19:21; Luke 23:37)</b> is used by Jews.
        All other
        <span class="bg-purple--d"> 13 times is used by gentiles</span>. Every
        time the title is used by the Jews is used as a sign of mockery or
        disdain, and only 1 of 13 times used by a gentile we can be sure is used
        seriously <b class="bg-green--l">(Matthew 2:2)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Jesus is referred to as King in a serious manner by a Jew, the more
        common Jewish term <b>"king of Israel"</b> is used
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Matthew 27:42; Mark 15:32)</b>. Therefore we see
        this title occurring on many occasions but only during two events of His
        life: <b>His birth and His death</b>. An even more interesting detail is
        that these Magi did not come to see just a baby who would one day become
        King of the Jews, but one who
        <b>τεχθεὶς (was born) King of the Jews</b>. Nobody is born a king. A
        newborn might come to this world as an heir to his father's, throne, but
        not as an already established king. For the firs time in the history of
        the world, a baby was born a king, or better said the King, and the Magi
        knew this.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        He was born <b> King of the Jews</b> because this was
        <span class="bg-orange">Jehovah</span> of the Old Testament, who was
        coming into the world but not into existence. <br />Before laying in a
        manger, He already sat on a throne
        <b class="bg-green--l">(psalm to 3:19)</b>. Before he was surrounded by
        a group of Magi, He already was surrounded by a host of angels
        <b class="bg-green--l">1 Kings 22:19</b>. Before He was wrapped in
        swaddling clothes, His robe already filled the Temple
        <b class="bg-green--l"> (Isaiah 66:1)</b>. Before Magi loaded donkeys
        and camels with gold and traveled across sandy roads, He was already
        making highways, bridges, and foundations with it
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Revelation 21:21)</b>. Before the Magi
        discovered the constellations in the sky He was already walking over
        them.
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Amos 4:13)</b>
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        The revelation of the Magi went far beyond the fact that He was a king,
        they knew He was the King. Because He was born king, He hung on the
        cross as King. Because He was born King Pilate had to write: I have
        written what I have written <b class="bg-green--l">(John 19:22)</b>

      <h3 class="c-red">The star: what was it?</h3>
      <img
        src="./assets/star.jpg"
        alt="Night sky full of stars"
        class="body-img"
      />
      <p>
        These great group of astrologers leave no room for doubt as to what was
        the catalyzer for their journey: a star. Nevertheless, we can deduct
        that this star was not just the common kind that we can appreciate on
        about every clear night. This was not just another star among the
        thousands. It is most certain that whatever phenomena they witnessed had
        to be something unprecedented for multiple reasons:
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--sm"></div>

      <ol class="padded-list">
        <li>
          These men were no common personalities. They were elite Persian
          <sup><b class="c-pink">3</b></sup> or Babylonian
          <sup><b class="c-pink">4</b></sup>
          scholars who's ancestors had been studying the heavenly bodies for
          thousands of years. It is quite clear that whatever astronomy
          phenomena sent them on their journey was not something small or
          something they had seen before.
        </li>
        <li>
          The road to Jerusalem from Babylon was not a short trip, neither was
          it easy. The journey was at least 550 miles across a quite difficult
          and sandy road. That is assuming that they came from Babylon. If thy
          came from persia as some argue, their trip was almost twice as long an
          much more difficult <sup><b class="c-pink">5</b></sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          Another reason to conclude that the star was in reality something much
          bigger and amazing than that is the fact that these Magi came to bring
          the news not to the pharisees or the teachers of the Law, but to
          Herod. Anyone with some common sense in those days knew that you don't
          approach a king to let him know he is about to be replaced. These Magi
          were bringing the news at the potential cost of their lives.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      So what was it that these men saw in reality? The answer is a difficult
      one, and one that we will never know with 100% certainty. At least not on
      this side of heaven. The theories range from a guiding angel to comets,
      nova stars, steroids, and more.
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      Multiple factors contribute to the difficulty of the text, for example the
      lack of description about the object and the meaning of the word
      <b>ἀστέρα</b> (star). Although the term is mainly used to refer to the
      relative small and shiny objects we see at night, the word is also used in
      the Scriptures as to mean planets. An example of this is
      <b class="bg-green--l">Jude 1:13</b>. He uses the phrase
      <b>ἀστέρες πλανῆται</b> which transliterated is
      <b class="bg-yellow">asteres planētai</b> (stars planets). The word
      <b>πλανῆται (planetai)</b> is a noun meaning
      <b class="bg-orange">wanderer</b>. Therefore, Jude is differentiating from
      the other kind of stars, the relatively <b>"fixed stars"</b> (when
      compared to the earth). It is possible, therefore, that what he has in
      mind here is the idea of a planet rather than a star. This idea is not
      hard to reconcile since even in our present day the Sun, the Earth, and
      most heavenly bodies can be referred to as stars.

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <p>
        Multiple possibilities are suggested for explaining the star of
        Bethlehem:
      </p>
      <ol class="padded-list">
        <li>Planet Venus</li>
        <li>Halley's Comet</li>
        <li>Fireball or Meteor Shower</li>
        <li>A Supernova star</li>
        <li>Triple planet conjunction</li>
        <li>A sequence of many events</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <h5>Venus</h5>

      <p>
        The word <b class="c-red">Venus</b> comes from the Roman goddess of love
        but the planet was discovered centuries before Roman civilization
        <sup><b class="c-pink">6</b></sup>

        The first observation of Venus can be dated to <b>1700 B. C.</b> by an
        Assyrian astronomer. We know from history that Babylonians knew the
        planet Venus as Istar or Ishtar who was the mother of the Gods.
        <sup><b class="c-pink">7</b></sup> and the personi­fication of
        Everything that was attractive in a woman.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <p>
        Alexander Hislop makes the connection of the
        <b class="c-red">Roman Venus</b> with the
        <b class="c-blue--d">Greek Aphrodite</b>, the
        <b class="bg-green--l">Babylonian Semiramis</b>, and the
        <b class="c-orange"> Asherah, Ashtoreth, or Astarte of the Canaanites</b
        ><sup><b class="c-pink">8</b></sup
        >, who's worship <span class="bg-blue--l">Solomon</span> endorsed and
        promoted <b class="bg-green--l">(2 Kings 23:13)</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        Venus can be seen around Christmas time most. years, and when it is high
        in the sky it shines quit brightly. <sup><b class="c-pink">9</b></sup
        >. Because it is seen around Christmas time and it can outshine the
        other stars when positioned in the right place, it has taken a popular
        place among the candidates for the <b>star of Bethlehem</b>. However, as
        stated before, The Magi, being acquainted with this star goddess,
        <b class="c-red">Venus</b> would have not been surprised by such event.
        They had been observing it for centuries, it is hard to imagine that
        such common event would send them on a voyage so long and onerous.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <h5>Halley's Comet.</h5>
      <p>
        The second theory most popular is that the star of Bethlehem was
        actually Halley's comet. <sup><b class="c-pink">10</b></sup> The Halley
        commit is what astrologers call a <b>"periodic comet"</b> which simply
        means that it has an orbit of less than <b>200 years</b>. The first
        recorded appearance of <b>Halley's comet</b> was in
        <b class="bg-purple--l"> £40 B.C.</b> and it is said to have been
        visible 28 times since then <sup><b class="c-pink">11</b></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <p>
        The Comet is named after the English astronomer
        <b class="bg-orange">Edmond Halley</b>, who in 1705 discovered that this
        comet, which had been observed before, had a consistent appearance of
        76.5 years, thus he successfully predicted the next appearance in 1758,
        since it had last happened in 16822.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <p>
        If the comet made an appearance in 1758 and 1682, we can can count
        backwards in intervals of -76.5. If we do this, we will find out that at
        interval <b>23</b> an appearance of the comet happens in year 0; very
        close to the approximated date of
        <b class="bg-purple--l"> Christ's birth</b>. However, recent astronomers
        have found out that the interval of the comet was not fixed, as Halley
        extrapolated. From ancient chinese records, it is assumed that a comet
        documented in 12 B.C. was indeed Halley's comet, which would throw off
        Halley's math and therefore eradicate the theory that the comet happened
        in year zero. This, in consequence discards the theory of Halley's comet
        as a possible answer for the star of Bethlehem from the list.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <h5>Fireball or Meteor Shower</h5>
      <p>
        Another possibility postulated to fill the role of this phenomena has
        been a <b class="c-red">Fireball </b>or a
        <b class="c-orange">Meteor Shower</b>. A fireball can actually surpass
        the brightness of the Moon in rare occasions, which would make for an
        spectacular event; Meteor showers, on the other hand, have been known by
        the Chinese and Babylonian Civilizations for more than 2000 years
        <sup><b class="c-pink">12</b></sup> and perhaps would not have caused as
        much of an amaze, but if this was at just a little more amazing than the
        ordinary, and if the direction it showered on was towards Jerusalem, it
        could have been interpreted by the Magi as a series os small signs
        pointing them towards the <b>Holy Land</b>.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        A meteor or a meteor shower, however, is also a very unlikely answer,
        since these phenomenon usually last
        <span class="bg-green--l"> less than a second</span>, yet, the Star the
        Magi observed went ahead of them
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Matthew 2:9)</b>. Not only that, but the Magi
        would have needed the repetition of the same event, as the star which
        they saw guided them first to <b>Jerusalem (west of Babylon)</b> but
        then also towards <b> Bethlehem (South of Jerusalem)</b>, something that
        adds to the unlikeliness of the event, since quite usually none of these
        occur on a close sequence.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <h5>A Supernova</h5>
      <p>
        A supernova is the death of a star. I will not go into the specific
        details of the event for two reasons: one, it would make for a lengthy
        read, and two and most importantly, the chemical and physical reactions
        that take place when a star dies are far beyond my knowledge. Suffice it
        to say that the
        <b>death of a star is an incredibly violent activity</b>, but at the
        same time it makes for a beautiful spectacle. The supernova ends in a
        massive explosion. In consequence the energy within the star is
        released. Supernovas are believed to be the second greatest generators
        of energy in the universe <sup><b class="c-pink">13</b></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        The light produced by a supernova can remain visible for up to
        <b>9 months</b>, which satisfies the issue of the journey time frame,
        since, as we have mentioned before, it probably took the Magi no longer
        than <b> 4 months</b> if they came from Babylon. On the other hand,
        according to astrological records, there has not been a Supernova that
        has occurred close enough to the time of Birth of our Lord, and thus,
        this option is typically also ruled out.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <h5>Triple planet conjunction</h5>
      <p>
        A planet conduction occurs when one astronomical object pass either
        north or South of another one producing the illusion, as seen from
        earth, that they are coming together, yet, most times this astronomical
        bodies can be <b>millions of miles</b> away from each other. This
        astronomical bodies can include <span class="bg-pink"> asteroids</span>,
        <span class="bg-blue--d"> moons</span>,
        <span class="bg-green--d"> planets</span>, and
        <span class="bg-gray"> stars</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        A popular conduction is the conjunction between Mars and Jupiter or Mars
        an Saturn that happens approximately every 2 years
        <sup><b class="c-pink">14</b></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        A triple conjunction is a little different than a normal conjunction and
        it happens when 2 astronomical bodies come together and separate, 3
        times, as appearing to <b class="c-blue--d">"dance"</b> with each other.
        This is a very rare event and not many are documented in history. This
        process is not a one day process, however, it can take months for a
        triple conjunction to finish, as each one of the conjunctions, or
        "crossings of the planets", are spread out and not immediately
        consecutive to each other. from the year
        <span class="bg-blue--l"
          >1000. B.C. to 7 A.D. only a total of 7 triple conjunctions are
          recorded</span
        >. This number includes only the conjunctions visible to the naked eye,
        of course, taking into consideration that there was no other means of
        observing this phenomena in the ancient world. A conjunction that is
        visible to the naked eye is something that is possible for those
        <b>planets in our orbit only</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        Special interest is paid to the one occurring in
        <b class="c-orange"> 7. B.C.</b> when considering candidates for the
        star of Bethlehem. This was a triple conjunction between
        <span class="bg-purple--d">Jupiter</span> and
        <span class="bg-red">Saturn</span> in the constellation of
        <span class="bg-blue--l">pisces</span>, a constellation usually
        associated with the Jews. astrological meaning.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <p>
        The conduction spread over a period of <b>seven months</b>, with the
        first conduction happening in <b>May 23rd</b>, the second in
        <b>October 5th</b>
        and the last one in <b>December 5th - 8th</b>
        <sup><b class="c-pink">15</b></sup
        >. Some believe that even though this happened at least a couple years
        before the birth of our Lord, the Magi took this as the first sign of a
        series that would follow and they kept awaiting for further instructions
        in the skies before making their trip. Others are not so optimistic
        about this explanation, for it is true that in ancient Babylon Saturn
        was regarded as a an evil planet <sup><b class="c-pink">16</b></sup
        >, thus this astronomical event would not have had a positive
        astrological meaning, and if there was not a positive astronomical
        meaning there is no possibility for a strong argument that supports that
        this was the catalyzer of their trip.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <h5>A sequence of many events</h5>
      <p>
        Mark R. Kidger, researcher of astrophysics, offers a different solution.
        Rather than paying attention to a single event, he states that the
        phenomena that sent the Magi on their journey was not the occurrence of
        a single phenomena but a
        <b class="c-purple--d"
          >compilation of astrologically meaningful events</b
        >. He proposes the following sequence of events:
        <sup><b class="c-pink">17</b></sup>
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--sm"></div>
      <ol class="padded-list">

      </ol>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

      <h6 class="c-orange">
        1. Triple conduction of Jupiter and saturn in 7 B.C.
      </h6>
      <p>
        The first case on the sequence of events that Kidger pays attention to
        is the triple conjunction of <b class="c-red">Jupiter</b> and
        <b class="c-gray">Saturn</b>, which as mentioned above, occurred in
        <b class="c-blue--d">Pisces</b>, the constellation of the Jews, This
        would have provoked special interest on these Babylonian/ Persian
        astrologers /astronomers. Because the conjunction involved
        <b>Jupiter, the planet of the king</b>,
        <sup><b class="c-pink">18</b></sup> and <b>Saturn, the evil planet</b>,
        they would assume that there was a confrontation between a king and
        evil, <sup><b class="c-pink">19</b></sup
        >, and from then on they kept watch with keen attention to the heavens
        for more signs.
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <h6 class="c-orange">
        2. The planetary amassing of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in 6. B.C.
      </h6>
      <p>
        The next sign in this sequence, says kiddger, was an amassing of the
        planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, that followed the triple conjunction.
        This happened in February 6 B.C., also in the constellations of Pisces.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <h6 class="c-orange">3. Pairing of Jupiter in Pisces in 5 B.C.</h6>
      <p>
        The third sign came in February 20, 5 B.C. when the moon passed very
        closely to <b class="c-red">Jupiter</b>. With this many sequential
        events happening in Pisces, the Maggi would have extrapolated that
        something was about to happen in <b class="bg-blue--l">Judea</b>. The
        speculation from the Magi that Kidger proposes is that
        <b> Jupiter, the Benevolent king</b> would crush

        4. A Nova star recorded in ancient Chinese records during 5 or 4 B.C
      </h6>
      <p>
        In the Spring of <b> 5 or 4 B. C.</b> the chinese recorded an object in
        the sky that shone brightly for <b>70 days</b>, this was also found in
        ancient Korean Records. Astronomers today agree that this phenomena was
        most probably a <b> supernova</b>. After witnessing the last three major
        astrological / astronomical events, the Nova was the sign that sealed
        the start of their journey. A very favorable argument to this event is
        that it happened during the
        <b class="bg-yellow"> birth year of the Lord Jesus Christ</b>, as
        extrapolated by some historians.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Of course, however convening any of these theories sound, we cannot
        prove their veracity nor accuracy. Regardless of how many more theories
        come up throughout the years, they will not cease to be only that,
        theories. Nevertheless, even when we cannot know with certainty whether
        the star was a miracle or an astronomical occurrence, we can be
        confident that this event was a true event, and that if God has the
        power to call stars into instance
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Genesis 1:16)</b> and to call then by name
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Psalm 147:4)</b>, He surely has the power to
        hang a new one to signal His coming to earth if He chooses so. This idea
        is hard to understand for the enemies of God's word, since the carnal
        man cannot know the things of the Spirit
        <b class="bg-green--l">(2 Cor. 2:14)</b>
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

        Critics of the Star of Bethlehem deny the appearance of a star and claim
        it was a made up tale by Matthew, and some even go as far as to deny the
        coming of the Magi to see Christ <sup><b class="c-pink">20</b></sup
        >. Critics, like R. M. Jenkins, claim that the story of Matthew was made
        up to convince Jewish readers that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, and to
        keep up with the custom of the time, in which astronomical events were
        interpreted to signal the birth and death of rulers
        <sup><b class="c-pink">21</b></sup
        >.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        The problem of the critic, however, is not the lack of evidence, but the
        lack of faith. Their problem is not that they know much about a specific
        scientific field that rules miracles out, but rather that they do not
        know the God who work miracles in.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        The fact that there is not enough evidence that the star indeed was a
        real occurrence, does not mean it was not.
        <b class="bg-blue--d"
          >Just because something is not testable or repeatable does not follow
          it is not possible</b
        >. It is unscientific to say that something is impossible only because
        it is not natural or testable. Critics of miracles often use this
        argument ignoring that their very argument rules out the most cherished
        foundations of science as the
        <b>Big bang or the theory of evolution</b>, for neither of those are
        natural nor can be tested. Hence, only because a miracle is not
        scientific, it does not follow is not possible.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, it is not the task of science to deal with the
        supernatural. There are at least four types of questions science cannot
        answer:
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <ul class="padded-list">
        <li>Morality and Ethics: What's good vs bad.</li>
        <li>Aestheticism: what's beautiful vs ugly.</li>
        <li>Questions of application: how to use your scientific knowledge.</li>
        <li>
          Supernatural Explanations: Does God exist? Do miracles happen? Science
          Cannot explain this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        Not matter how much the critic tries to disprove Biblical truths, their
        best explanations will never go beyond the status of being a theory. As
        for us, Children of God and worshipers of Jesus Christ, should not loose
        sleep over small details as this. We hold fast to the truth that Christ
        indeed came, died, and resurrected regardless of what the sign that
        brought the Magi around was.

        I think it has been the problem of any thinking mind to question what
        would happen to those who have never hear the gospel? What about those
        poor tribes living under a hoot and eating their neighboring fellows? Is
        it just for God to condemn them to Hell simply because they have not
        heard the Gospel? Is not this a fault of the church rather than of these
        poor people? How can a loving and just God do this?
      </p>

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        The first thing we must remember is that before the world had borders
        and gaps, God had already designed the specific place and era where you
        and I would be born <b class="bg-green--l">(Act.`17 26:)</b>. The second
        fact is that He is not limited by geographical circumstances. Could He
        have created the earth and those living in it, and yet fail to deliver
        to them the only message of hope? Of course not. He will reveal Himself
        to whomever He wants to reveal Himself to
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Exo. 33:19)</b>. And His desire is that everyone
        turns to Him <b class="bg-green--l">(Ezekiel 18:32)</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer--md"></div>
      <p>
        Therefore, the question is, can people who have never known Jesus
        Christ, and as a result have not accepted Him as Lord, be saved? The
        answer is a big <b>NO</b>!
        <b>There is no salvation outside Jesus Christ</b>

        It does not matter whether a person has heard the gospel or not, if
        there is no heaven without a relationship with Christ. Hence, should we
        feel bad about the poor man/ woman in the middle of nowhere who weeps
        and seeks unendingly for God but has no one to preach to him/ her? The
        truth is that feeling sorry for such person would feel as feeling sorry
        for a fictitious character of a comics book because that person does not
        exist.

        Whether is through a missionary or through a dream or vision, God will

        My main concern, however, is not about the fellow out there in the

        As seen in the contextual background above, these Pagan Magi had a
        revelation that most Jews did not and they were not afraid to act upon
        it. They were aware that Herod was the king over Judea and they were not
        afraid to act based on that. They talked to Herod straight to the face
        and told him there was a new King, one that was worthy of worship. How
        infuriating this must had been for this prideful Idumean; The Magi had
        not pay payed any worship to him. As a matter of fact, he most probably
        not even received a rock wrapped up in gift paper from them, but here
        they are, with beasts loaded of gifts and ready to bow down to the Only
        One who is worthy.

        No wonder why God decided that they were the ones fit for the mission.
        <b>
          They received a revelation and they were brave enough to act on it</b
        >. I wonder how many wonderful things we keep ourselves from simply
        because we are just too coward to to pay the price. Is it a calling to
        be a Missionary? Perhaps a call to give a certain percentage of our
        income to Him? Maybe it is a call to pastor a church or to quit a Job to
        go into ministry full time? Perhaps is a call to have a serious prayer
        life or to share His wonderful news with a family member? Whatever it
        is, one thing is true:
        <b class="bg-yellow"
          >God will never force us to do anything for Him, but oh what a
          miserable life living out of His will would make for ourselves.</b
        >. How sorrowful it must be to get to an old age, sit on the porch on
        your favorite rocking chair, and just as you are about enjoy of a
        beautiful sunset, the first thing that comes to our mind being:
        <b class="bg-pink"
          >"I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't let fear and doubt steer
          my decision to..." "I Wonder what would've happened if I hadn't given
          up on...", "I wonder what if..."
        </b>
        The Kingdom of God requires of brave men and women to enter it and to
        stay in it
        <b class="bg-green--l">(Matt. 11:12)</b>. Whatever God is asking you to
        do that you think is too hard, my friend, will never be as hard as
        paying for the mistake of your disobedience.

      <div class="spacer--md"></div>

        One last lesson important to mention, as well, is that God will never
        lack worshipers. When the priests of Judaism refused to worship Him, He
        brought the priests of Zoroaster. He will never lack a tongue, who
        worships Him or knee to bend before Him. If we shut our mouth, the rocks
        will talk <b class="bg-green--l">(Luk. 19:40)</b>.
